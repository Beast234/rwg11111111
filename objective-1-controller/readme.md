# Objective 1: Controller
The goal here is to stand up a basic listener that connects your bot to Alexa.

## Setup
Each objective in the repo runs as a separate project. From the gypsy-bot-tutorial folder (or whatever you named it), navigate to the objective-1-controller sub directory.

Before running, you will need to run "npm install" from within the directory.

Also, you will need to update the relevant keys in the .env file.  The SUBDOMAIN is something of your choosing.  Try to make it unique, as it can conflict w/ other free public users.

After these steps you can start the bot by running "npm run start" from the "objective-1-controller" subdirectory.
