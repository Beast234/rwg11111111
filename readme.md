# Build your first Bot in 90 min
This workshop is intended to be an intro primer to the world of conversant as well as a hands on exploration into how modern day bots are constructed.  This workshop does not require past hands on coding, but as always experience does help.

The following presentation - [90min bot](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zCaN6QuQS-PTe932nApASa3wpnt1kIWqrnPWSZJb-3I/edit#slide=id.g19fcfbc1e2_0_58) - at least introduces some of the core concepts, but try to attend a live session for the meat of the detail.

### Technologies Used

The following technologies are used:

- [JavaScript](http://www.w3schools.com/js/)
- [BotKit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit)
- [uTu.ai](https://github.com/utu-ai/utu-javascript-sdk)
- [Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html#/skills/list)

### Objectives

Again, this workshop is intended to be a preliminary primer on the conversant space.  The content is organized around initial key learning objectives:

- Objective 1: Controller.  Here we delineate between your bot and the channels in which you engage.  A line that is frequently blurred.
- Objective 2: AI.  Define what outcomes you are trying to achieve for your users.  Define intents.
- Objective 3: NLP.  Art meets science.  Craft utterances that help guide users.
- Objective 4: Analytics.  See what is happening where and why for who.

Additional details on setting up and running each objective contained in local
readme's in each objective subfolder.

### Setup

- [IDE](http://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/) of your choosing (we use atom... mostly)
- [Node & NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)
