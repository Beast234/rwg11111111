# Objective 2: AI
Goal here is to get a basic send and response to the Alexa platform and to establish intents for GypsyBot.

## Setup
Each objective in the repo runs as a separate project. From the gypsy-bot-tutorial folder (or whatever you named it), navigate to the objective-2-ai sub directory.

Before running, you will need to run "npm install" from within the directory.

Also, you will need to update the relevant keys in the .env file.  The ALEXA_APPID can be found in the amazon Alexa developer portal.  The SUBDOMAIN is something of your choosing.  Try to make it unique, as it can conflict w/ other free public users.

After these steps you can start the bot by running "npm run start" from the "objective-2-ai" subdirectory.
